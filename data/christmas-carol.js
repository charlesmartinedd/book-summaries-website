            content: `<p>Ebenezer Scrooge is a mean, greedy old man who hates Christmas. He refuses to give money to the poor and won't even let his clerk, Bob Cratchit, have a warm fire at work. When his cheerful nephew Fred invites him to Christmas dinner, Scrooge growls his famous words: "Bah! Humbug!" He thinks Christmas is just an excuse for people to pick his pockets and waste time.</p>
                      <p>That evening, as Scrooge eats his lonely supper in his cold, dark house, something strange happens. The door knocker on his front door suddenly transforms into the ghostly face of Jacob Marley, his business partner who died exactly seven years ago on Christmas Eve!</p>
                      <p>Later that night, Marley's ghost appears in Scrooge's bedroom. The spirit is wrapped in heavy chains made of money boxes, keys, padlocks, and steel purses. Marley explains that he made these chains during his lifetime by being greedy and ignoring people who needed help. Now he must wear them forever as punishment.</p>
                      <p>Marley warns Scrooge that his own chain is even longer and heavier! But there is still hope. Three spirits will visit Scrooge that night to show him the error of his ways. If Scrooge listens to them, he might escape Marley's terrible fate. The clock strikes one, and Scrooge waits nervously for the first ghost to appear.</p>`

            summary: "The first spirit looks like a strange child with a bright light shining from its head. This ghost takes Scrooge back in time to see his own past.",
            content: `<p>At exactly one o'clock, Scrooge's bed curtains are pulled aside by the strangest creature he has ever seen. The Ghost of Christmas Past looks like both a child and an old person at the same time. A bright, clear light shines from the top of its head, and it carries a cap shaped like a candle snuffer. The ghost tells Scrooge it has come for his welfare and takes his hand.</p>
                      <p>Together, they fly through the window and travel back in time! Scrooge finds himself at his old boarding school, where he sees himself as a lonely young boy. All the other students have gone home for Christmas, but young Scrooge sits alone, forgotten by his family. A single tear rolls down old Scrooge's cheek as he remembers how sad and abandoned he felt.</p>
                      <p>The ghost then shows Scrooge a happier memory: a Christmas party thrown by his first employer, Mr. Fezziwig. Young Scrooge dances and laughs with all the other workers. Mr. Fezziwig spent only a little money on the party, but he made everyone so happy! Scrooge realizes that a good boss can bring joy without spending a fortune—something he never does for poor Bob Cratchit.</p>
                      <p>The final memory is the most painful of all. Scrooge sees his younger self with Belle, the beautiful woman he once loved. She is crying as she breaks off their engagement, telling him that he now loves money more than he loves her. Then the ghost shows Scrooge what became of Belle: she married another man and now has a happy family full of laughing children. Scrooge begs the ghost to take him home. He cannot bear to see what he gave up for gold.</p>`

            summary: "The second spirit is a giant dressed in a green robe, surrounded by a huge feast. This ghost shows Scrooge how people celebrate Christmas right now.",
            content: `<p>When the clock strikes one again, Scrooge's room transforms into a magical scene. The walls and ceiling are covered with holly, mistletoe, and ivy. A roaring fire blazes in the fireplace. And sitting on a throne made of turkeys, geese, and Christmas puddings is the Ghost of Christmas Present—a jolly giant dressed in a green velvet robe trimmed with white fur!</p>
                      <p>The ghost carries a glowing torch shaped like a cornucopia, and wherever its light falls, people become kinder and more generous. The spirit takes Scrooge through the snowy streets of London on Christmas morning, showing him how even the poorest families find reasons to celebrate. People wave and call "Merry Christmas!" to strangers on the street.</p>
                      <p>They visit the tiny home of Bob Cratchit, Scrooge's underpaid clerk. Despite their poverty, the Cratchit family is bursting with joy! Mrs. Cratchit prepares a small Christmas goose while the children help set the table. Then Bob arrives home carrying his youngest son, Tiny Tim, on his shoulders. Tim is a frail, sweet boy who walks with a little crutch, but his spirit shines brighter than anyone's. As the family says grace, Tim calls out, "God bless us, every one!" When Scrooge asks about Tim's future, the ghost delivers terrible news: without more food and medicine, the boy will die.</p>
                      <p>The ghost then takes Scrooge to his nephew Fred's Christmas party, where guests are playing games and laughing. Fred proposes a toast to Uncle Scrooge, even though the guests think he's a horrible old miser! Before the ghost disappears, it reveals two starving children hiding beneath its robe: a boy named Ignorance and a girl named Want. The ghost warns that these children—representing poverty and suffering—will destroy humanity if people like Scrooge continue to ignore them.</p>`

            title: "Stave 4: The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come",
            image: "images/christmas-carol/stave-4.png",
            summary: "The third spirit is the scariest of all. It wears a black hood and never speaks. This ghost shows Scrooge the future.",
            content: `<p>As the final ghost approaches, Scrooge trembles with fear. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is the most terrifying spirit of all—a tall, dark phantom draped in a black hooded robe. The ghost never speaks and only points with one bony finger. Scrooge can see nothing of the creature except that single pointing hand. Though he is terrified, Scrooge knows he must follow.</p>
                      <p>The ghost takes Scrooge to the London streets, where businessmen stand in a group laughing about someone who just died. "I don't know anyone who will go to his funeral," one says. "I'll only go if lunch is provided!" jokes another. Scrooge is shocked that anyone could be so unloved.</p>
                      <p>Next, they visit a dirty shop where thieves are selling items stolen from a dead man's house—his bed curtains, his blankets, even the shirt he was supposed to be buried in! The thieves laugh at how the dead man got what he deserved for being so mean and stingy. Scrooge is disgusted but does not yet realize that this dead man is himself.</p>
                      <p>The ghost then shows Scrooge the Cratchit home, but this time it is silent and sad. The family is dressed in mourning clothes, crying quietly. Tiny Tim has died. His little crutch sits by the empty fireplace, and Bob Cratchit sobs that he will never forget his beloved son. Finally, the ghost points toward a dark, forgotten graveyard. Scrooge kneels before a neglected tombstone covered in weeds. He wipes away the dirt and reads the name: EBENEZER SCROOGE. Falling to his knees, Scrooge grabs the ghost's robe and begs for another chance. He promises to honor Christmas and change his ways!</p>`

            summary: "Scrooge wakes up on Christmas morning a completely different person. He is so happy to be alive!",
            content: `<p>Scrooge wakes up tangled in his own bed curtains—the curtains that weren't stolen! He's alive! He leaps out of bed laughing like a madman. He doesn't know what day it is, what month it is, or how long he's been with the spirits. He runs to the window and calls down to a boy on the street: "What day is it?" When the boy answers "Christmas Day," Scrooge can hardly believe his luck. The spirits did everything in one night!</p>
                      <p>Scrooge sends the boy to buy the biggest turkey in the shop window—one so enormous it could never walk—and has it delivered anonymously to the Cratchit family. He dances around his room, laughing and crying at the same time. He has never felt so alive! Getting dressed in his finest clothes, Scrooge heads out into the snowy streets of London.</p>
                      <p>On the street, Scrooge meets one of the charity collectors he rudely rejected the day before. Instead of turning away, Scrooge whispers an enormous donation in the man's ear—so large that the collector nearly faints! Scrooge tips his hat to strangers, pats children on the head, and calls "Merry Christmas!" to everyone he sees. Then he does something he's never done before: he goes to his nephew Fred's house for Christmas dinner. When Fred sees his uncle at the door, he's so surprised he can barely speak—but he welcomes him with open arms.</p>
                      <p>The next morning, Scrooge arrives at work early and waits for Bob Cratchit, who comes in 18 minutes late. Scrooge pretends to be angry, growling at Bob in his old mean voice. Then he bursts out laughing! He gives Bob a huge raise and promises to help his struggling family. Scrooge becomes like a second father to Tiny Tim, who does NOT die. From that day forward, Scrooge keeps the spirit of Christmas alive in his heart every single day of the year. And as Tiny Tim would say: "God bless us, every one!"</p>`
