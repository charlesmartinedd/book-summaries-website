            content: `<p>Ebenezer Scrooge is a mean, greedy old man who hates Christmas. He refuses to give money to the poor and won't even let his clerk, Bob Cratchit, have a warm fire at work. When his cheerful nephew Fred invites him to Christmas dinner, Scrooge growls his famous words: "Bah! Humbug!" He thinks Christmas is just an excuse for people to pick his pockets and waste time.</p>
                      <p>That evening, as Scrooge eats his lonely supper in his cold, dark house, something strange happens. The door knocker on his front door suddenly transforms into the ghostly face of Jacob Marley, his business partner who died exactly seven years ago on Christmas Eve!</p>
                      <p>Later that night, Marley's ghost appears in Scrooge's bedroom. The spirit is wrapped in heavy chains made of money boxes, keys, padlocks, and steel purses. Marley explains that he made these chains during his lifetime by being greedy and ignoring people who needed help. Now he must wear them forever as punishment.</p>
                      <p>Marley warns Scrooge that his own chain is even longer and heavier! But there is still hope. Three spirits will visit Scrooge that night to show him the error of his ways. If Scrooge listens to them, he might escape Marley's terrible fate. The clock strikes one, and Scrooge waits nervously for the first ghost to appear.</p>`

            summary: "The first spirit looks like a strange child with a bright light shining from its head. This ghost takes Scrooge back in time to see his own past.",
            content: `<p>At exactly one o'clock, Scrooge's bed curtains are pulled aside by the strangest creature he has ever seen. The Ghost of Christmas Past looks like both a child and an old person at the same time. A bright, clear light shines from the top of its head, and it carries a cap shaped like a candle snuffer. The ghost tells Scrooge it has come for his welfare and takes his hand.</p>
                      <p>Together, they fly through the window and travel back in time! Scrooge finds himself at his old boarding school, where he sees himself as a lonely young boy. All the other students have gone home for Christmas, but young Scrooge sits alone, forgotten by his family. A single tear rolls down old Scrooge's cheek as he remembers how sad and abandoned he felt.</p>
                      <p>The ghost then shows Scrooge a happier memory: a Christmas party thrown by his first employer, Mr. Fezziwig. Young Scrooge dances and laughs with all the other workers. Mr. Fezziwig spent only a little money on the party, but he made everyone so happy! Scrooge realizes that a good boss can bring joy without spending a fortune—something he never does for poor Bob Cratchit.</p>
                      <p>The final memory is the most painful of all. Scrooge sees his younger self with Belle, the beautiful woman he once loved. She is crying as she breaks off their engagement, telling him that he now loves money more than he loves her. Then the ghost shows Scrooge what became of Belle: she married another man and now has a happy family full of laughing children. Scrooge begs the ghost to take him home. He cannot bear to see what he gave up for gold.</p>`

            summary: "The second spirit is a giant dressed in a green robe, surrounded by a huge feast. This ghost shows Scrooge how people celebrate Christmas right now.",
            content: `<p>When the clock strikes one again, Scrooge's room transforms into a magical scene. The walls and ceiling are covered with holly, mistletoe, and ivy. A roaring fire blazes in the fireplace. And sitting on a throne made of turkeys, geese, and Christmas puddings is the Ghost of Christmas Present—a jolly giant dressed in a green velvet robe trimmed with white fur!</p>
                      <p>The ghost carries a glowing torch shaped like a cornucopia, and wherever its light falls, people become kinder and more generous. The spirit takes Scrooge through the snowy streets of London on Christmas morning, showing him how even the poorest families find reasons to celebrate. People wave and call "Merry Christmas!" to strangers on the street.</p>
                      <p>They visit the tiny home of Bob Cratchit, Scrooge's underpaid clerk. Despite their poverty, the Cratchit family is bursting with joy! Mrs. Cratchit prepares a small Christmas goose while the children help set the table. Then Bob arrives home carrying his youngest son, Tiny Tim, on his shoulders. Tim is a frail, sweet boy who walks with a little crutch, but his spirit shines brighter than anyone's. As the family says grace, Tim calls out, "God bless us, every one!" When Scrooge asks about Tim's future, the ghost delivers terrible news: without more food and medicine, the boy will die.</p>
                      <p>The ghost then takes Scrooge to his nephew Fred's Christmas party, where guests are playing games and laughing. Fred proposes a toast to Uncle Scrooge, even though the guests think he's a horrible old miser! Before the ghost disappears, it reveals two starving children hiding beneath its robe: a boy named Ignorance and a girl named Want. The ghost warns that these children—representing poverty and suffering—will destroy humanity if people like Scrooge continue to ignore them.</p>`

            image: "images/christmas-carol/stave-4.png",
            summary: "The third spirit is the scariest of all. It wears a black hood and never speaks. This ghost shows Scrooge the future.",
            content: `<p>As the final ghost approaches, Scrooge trembles with fear. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is the most terrifying spirit of all—a tall, dark phantom draped in a black hooded robe. The ghost never speaks and only points with one bony finger. Scrooge can see nothing of the creature except that single pointing hand. Though he is terrified, Scrooge knows he must follow.</p>
                      <p>The ghost takes Scrooge to the London streets, where businessmen stand in a group laughing about someone who just died. "I don't know anyone who will go to his funeral," one says. "I'll only go if lunch is provided!" jokes another. Scrooge is shocked that anyone could be so unloved.</p>
                      <p>Next, they visit a dirty shop where thieves are selling items stolen from a dead man's house—his bed curtains, his blankets, even the shirt he was supposed to be buried in! The thieves laugh at how the dead man got what he deserved for being so mean and stingy. Scrooge is disgusted but does not yet realize that this dead man is himself.</p>
                      <p>The ghost then shows Scrooge the Cratchit home, but this time it is silent and sad. The family is dressed in mourning clothes, crying quietly. Tiny Tim has died. His little crutch sits by the empty fireplace, and Bob Cratchit sobs that he will never forget his beloved son. Finally, the ghost points toward a dark, forgotten graveyard. Scrooge kneels before a neglected tombstone covered in weeds. He wipes away the dirt and reads the name: EBENEZER SCROOGE. Falling to his knees, Scrooge grabs the ghost's robe and begs for another chance. He promises to honor Christmas and change his ways!</p>`

            summary: "Scrooge wakes up on Christmas morning a completely different person. He is so happy to be alive!",
            content: `<p>Scrooge wakes up tangled in his own bed curtains—the curtains that weren't stolen! He's alive! He leaps out of bed laughing like a madman. He doesn't know what day it is, what month it is, or how long he's been with the spirits. He runs to the window and calls down to a boy on the street: "What day is it?" When the boy answers "Christmas Day," Scrooge can hardly believe his luck. The spirits did everything in one night!</p>
                      <p>Scrooge sends the boy to buy the biggest turkey in the shop window—one so enormous it could never walk—and has it delivered anonymously to the Cratchit family. He dances around his room, laughing and crying at the same time. He has never felt so alive! Getting dressed in his finest clothes, Scrooge heads out into the snowy streets of London.</p>
                      <p>On the street, Scrooge meets one of the charity collectors he rudely rejected the day before. Instead of turning away, Scrooge whispers an enormous donation in the man's ear—so large that the collector nearly faints! Scrooge tips his hat to strangers, pats children on the head, and calls "Merry Christmas!" to everyone he sees. Then he does something he's never done before: he goes to his nephew Fred's house for Christmas dinner. When Fred sees his uncle at the door, he's so surprised he can barely speak—but he welcomes him with open arms.</p>
                      <p>The next morning, Scrooge arrives at work early and waits for Bob Cratchit, who comes in 18 minutes late. Scrooge pretends to be angry, growling at Bob in his old mean voice. Then he bursts out laughing! He gives Bob a huge raise and promises to help his struggling family. Scrooge becomes like a second father to Tiny Tim, who does NOT die. From that day forward, Scrooge keeps the spirit of Christmas alive in his heart every single day of the year. And as Tiny Tim would say: "God bless us, every one!"</p>`

Fred's wife and the other guests thought Scrooge was disagreeable and didn't deserve such kindness, but Fred remained hopeful that his uncle might change."

                    question: "What did Scrooge do while his nephew and the others were playing games?",
                    answer: "Scrooge watched invisibly as the guests played games, and he became caught up in the fun! He laughed along with them and even called out answers to the games, forgetting that nobody could hear him. He was enjoying himself more than he had in years."

                    answer: "The 'Yes and No' game was a guessing game where one person thinks of something and the others ask yes-or-no questions to figure out what it is. The subject of the game was Uncle Scrooge himself! The guests guessed he was an animal (because of how he acted), that he lived in London, that he was disagreeable, and finally that he was Scrooge—which made everyone laugh."

                    answer: "Scrooge likely felt a mix of shame and surprise. He heard Mrs. Cratchit criticize him harshly, calling him stingy and disagreeable, while Bob defended toasting him out of gratitude for his job. Hearing how his meanness affected others probably made Scrooge feel guilty. Overhearing people talk about you can be uncomfortable—it forces you to see yourself through others' eyes and realize how your actions affect people around you."

The only visible part was one outstretched hand. It never spoke—it only pointed with its skeletal finger. It looked like the Grim Reaper, the symbol of death. Scrooge was terrified of this spirit more than any other. He said, 'I fear you more than any spectre I have seen.' His knees trembled as he followed the phantom, but he knew he had to go with it to learn his lesson."

They overheard the men casually discussing someone's recent death. The businessmen joked that the dead man's funeral would probably be very cheap, and said they would only attend if lunch was served.

                    answer: "Scrooge was deeply afraid of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, more than he had been of the other two spirits. However, he also showed acceptance and willingness to learn. He told the spirit that he knew its purpose was to do him good, and that he hoped to become a different man from what he was.

There, three people arrived to sell items they had stolen from a dead man's house—bed curtains, blankets, silver, clothing, and even the shirt the dead man was supposed to be buried in. Scrooge was horrified and disgusted by this scene. He realized how terrible it was that someone could die so unloved that people would steal from their corpse."

                    question: "What did Scrooge think about when he saw the dead man?",
                    answer: "When the Spirit showed Scrooge a dead body lying alone in a dark room, covered with a sheet, Scrooge thought about how lonely and sad this death was. He could not bring himself to lift the sheet and see who had died. He thought about whether anyone mourned this person, whether anyone cared, and he desperately wanted to see some tenderness or emotion connected to this death—but there was none."
                },
                {
                    question: "What did Scrooge ask the Spirit to show him next? What did the Ghost show him?",
                    answer: "Scrooge begged the Spirit to show him someone who felt emotion about this death—anyone who cared. The Ghost showed him a young couple who actually seemed relieved by the death because they owed money to the dead man and now had more time to pay. Then the Spirit showed him the Cratchit family, who were mourning—but they were mourning Tiny Tim, who had died. This was the tenderness Scrooge had asked to see, but it broke his heart."

He told Bob that if there was anything he needed, Bob should come to him. This kindness touched Bob deeply during his time of grief and showed that Fred was the opposite of his uncle Scrooge."

When Scrooge wiped away the dirt and read the name carved on the stone, he saw his own name: EBENEZER SCROOGE. He finally realized that he was the unloved, unmourned dead man everyone had been talking about throughout the night."

                    question: "What question did Scrooge ask the Ghost as they stood among the graves?",
                    answer: "Scrooge asked the Ghost whether the shadows he had been shown were the shadows of things that WILL be, or only the shadows of things that MAY be. He wanted to know if this terrible future was set in stone, or if he could still change it by changing his ways. He desperately hoped that his fate was not sealed."

                    question: "What did Scrooge tell the Ghost he would do?",
                    answer: "Scrooge fell to his knees and grabbed the Ghost's robe, making a solemn promise. He vowed that he would honor Christmas in his heart and try to keep it all year long. He promised to live in the Past, Present, and Future—learning from all three spirits. He swore he would change his ways and not be the man he had been. He begged for a chance to prove that he could change."

                    answer: "The story suggests that our future is not set in stone—we have the power to change it through our choices. Scrooge's question to the Ghost shows that he believed people can alter their fate by changing their behavior. The story's message is hopeful: no matter how badly someone has lived, it is never too late to change. Every day we make choices that shape our future, and choosing kindness, generosity, and love can lead to a completely different outcome than choosing greed and selfishness."

He jumped out of bed and danced around his room, feeling giddy with happiness. He said, 'I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a drunken man!' He didn't know what day it was or how long he had been with the spirits, but he felt reborn and full of life."

                    answer: "When Scrooge woke up, it was Christmas Day morning! Amazingly, only ONE night had passed. The three spirits had visited him all in a single night, even though it felt much longer. Scrooge was thrilled to discover he hadn't missed Christmas and still had time to change his ways and make things right. The spirits had done it all in one night!"

Scrooge wanted to send it anonymously to the Cratchit family so they could have a proper Christmas feast.

He walked through the streets patting children on the head, talking happily to beggars, and finding that everything made him joyful. He had never realized how wonderful it felt to be kind to others and to be part of the community he had shut out for so long."

This time, instead of turning away, Scrooge approached him warmly and apologized for his behavior. Then he leaned in and whispered an enormous donation in the man's ear—so large that the gentleman nearly fainted from shock! Scrooge promised to give much more in the future to help the poor and make up for lost time."

When Fred saw his uncle at the door, he was so shocked he could barely speak. But Fred recovered quickly and welcomed Scrooge with open arms and great joy. Scrooge had a wonderful time at the party, playing games, laughing, and enjoying the company of family—something he hadn't done in many years."

Scrooge pretended to be angry, growling in his old mean voice and threatening to raise Bob's salary! Bob was confused until Scrooge burst out laughing. Scrooge told Bob he was going to raise his salary, help his struggling family, and become like a second father to Tiny Tim. He also promised they would discuss Bob's affairs over a warm bowl of punch."

Scrooge learned to honor Christmas in his heart and keep its spirit alive every single day of the year. He learned that money means nothing without people to share life with, that kindness brings more joy than wealth ever could, and that it is never too late to change and become a better person. As Tiny Tim would say: 'God bless us, every one!'"

                    question: "Think About It: Imagine being a villager in the town where Scrooge lives. What would it be like to see him now? What questions would you have? How would you react?",
                    answer: "As a villager, seeing Scrooge's transformation would be absolutely shocking! For years, everyone knew him as the meanest, coldest man in London—someone who said 'Bah! Humbug!' to Christmas and refused to help anyone. Suddenly seeing him laughing, giving to charity, and wishing people 'Merry Christmas' would be hard to believe. You might wonder: 'What happened to him? Is this a trick? Did he hit his head?' But as time passed and his kindness continued, you would realize his change was real. You might feel hopeful—if even Scrooge can change, maybe anyone can become a better person."
